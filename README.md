# ❤️ Coronary Heart Disease Prediction System
A machine learning-based web application that predicts the risk of Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) using patient clinical data. The system uses an XGBoost model combined with feature scaling and provides an interactive interface for real-time risk prediction.

### 📌 Features

- Predicts coronary heart disease risk based on patient health parameters.
- Automatic BMI calculation from height and weight.
- Uses trained XGBoost machine learning model.
- Real-time prediction through Flask web interface.
- Input validation using web forms.
- Scaled feature preprocessing for accurate predictions.
